  But what is a <b>CellID?</b>: a CellID is the unique number of a GSM cell for a given operator. Your phone is
  always connected to a Cell, and by nowing this number, you know the Cell, and by knowing the position of the
  cell, you know where you are. There is some accuracy issue, as the cell can cover from several hundreds of meters
  to several kilometers, but this could be a very good starting point to locate yourself.<br/>
